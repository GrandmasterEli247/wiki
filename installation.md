# Installation

> How to install CyberScript in your system. 

?> Right now, CyberScript can be installed in three operating systems, **Windows 10 or 11**, **Linux or Steam Deck.** Follow the guides carefully to avoid rewriting some other files. <br><br>**Starting the Installation assuming, you have already downloaded the mod file.**

# Windows

- Open the `Downloaded ZIP` file using any software you like (ex. [7Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/), [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/))
- It contains a folder called `bin`.
- Copy or Extract the `bin` folder to your game installed folder.

# IMPORTANT FOR 7zip Users:

!!!! If you download a datapack and just copy the /bin/ folder from it to the Cyberpunk folder in Windows 11 using the FileExplorer app INSTEAD of opening the zip in 7zip or something else Windows Defender will automatically "block" every file contained inside. open the zip file with 7zip or anythign but windows explorer.  Or just start packing it as a rar or .7z so that windows explorer can't open it.!!!!!
